          <p>After completing a national-award winning PhD in computer science in 2007, and then a research internship at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, Bernard returned to the University of Melbourne to take up a lecturing position in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering. In 2010 he joined the newly-formed VLSCI (now Melbourne Bioinformatics), a $100M project to build a world-leading centre for bioinformatics and computational biology. In making the transition from computer science to bioinformatics, Bernard recognised the exciting new opportunities provided by the genomics revolution in biomedicine, and was inspired to apply his computing and analytic skills to important problems in human health.</p><p>During his years at Melbourne Bioinformatics, Bernard has established himself as an expert in the development of novel techniques for the analysis of large-scale genomics data sets, resulting in the production of tools which have driven key discoveries in human disease, and which can be re-applied in many different contexts. As Lead Bioinformatician for Human Genomics, Bernard heads several high profile, multidisciplinary research projects, with national and international partners.</p><p>In 2017 Bernard was awarded a Victorian Health and Medical Research Fellowship, funded by the Victorian Government.</p>

          <h4 class="my-3">Career summary</h4>
          <p>Ben Tran is a Medical Oncologist, MBBS, FRACP at the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and is a Clinician Scientist at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. His clinical focus is Genitourinary (GU) tumour stream, particular, testicular and urothelial cancers. Dr Tran’s research interests uniquely occupy the two ends of the spectrum in Early Drug Development, and Real World Data (RWD). He set up Australia’s first National Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Registry (ePAD), Australia’s first Testicular Cancer Registry (iTestis) and Australia’s first Bladder Cancer Registry (BLADDA). He believes that establishing robust platforms for RWD collection can facilitate research, not only data-related, but also translational by linking to tissue and blood specimens, and clinical through the conduct of registry-based trials. Grant funding has allowed him to conduct much of this research; since returning to Australia in early 2012, awarded several grants totalling almost $10M. Following completion of Medical Oncology training in Australia, Dr Tran completed an overseas Fellowship in Drug Development and Urological cancers at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada. There, he gained extensive experience in treating GU cancers, conducting Phase I clinical trials, implementing a large scale molecular profiling program and managing large multi-centre databases containing real world patient data. Dr Tran is currently leading the GU medical oncology program at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and the GU clinical trials program within the Parkville Cancer Clinical Trials Unit. Additionally, he holds several leadership positions within the National GU community, including Chair of the GU Tumour Group within Cancer Trials Australia, and Chair of the ANZUP Germ Cell Tumour Subcommittee. Regularly, Dr Tran is invited to speak at National scientific meetings and has been a member of the organising committee for several National conferences. He established Australia’s first Phase I clinic and is Principal Investigator on several Phase I studies including First Time in Human studies. Dr Tran’s research are internationally recognised with several International collaborations that have led to publications and presentations at International meetings, particularly in testicular cancer. He is on steering committees of two multinational research projects in testicular cancer, and have conducted research that has led to changes in clinical practice world-wide.</p>

          <p>Dr Edmond Kwan is a Medical Oncologist and translational researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  In his role as a Principal Investigator in the Urology-Oncology Clinical Trials Program, he leads multiple investigator-led and industry-sponsored studies in prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma. His primary research interest is in genitourinary malignancies and circulating biomarker research.  Dr Kwan is currently completing his PhD at Monash University, focusing on identifying mechanisms of drug resistance in advanced prostate cancer through the analysis of circulating DNA and RNA in the blood, supported by a postgraduate scholarship from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). His work has led to a publication in the high impact journal European Urology, multiple oral/poster presentations at national/international conferences and positive grant funding to support the development of a circulating tumour DNA panel in patients with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. In August 2020, Dr Kwan will relocate to University College London to undertake a prostate cancer postdoctoral fellowship in the Treatment Resistance Laboratory led up Professor Gerhardt Attard. Ultimately, Dr Kwan intends on returning to Australia and establishing long-term roots as a clinician researcher at a major academic institution leading innovative projects that seek to benefit patients with urological malignancies.</p>

          <p>Katie Owen is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Parker laboratory at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, headed by Associate Professor Belinda Parker. As an active member of both PRECEPT and the international prostate cancer research consortium, ProMis, Katie’s work focuses on understanding the immunoregulatory mechanisms that govern bone metastasis in castrate-resistant prostate cancer, including tumour cell dormancy and the eventual outgrowth of prostate cancer cells in the bone microenvironment. Her research has identified that suppression of a key innate immune signalling pathway in prostate cancer cells in bone impacts both bone homeostasis and immune surveillance mechanisms to engender a tumour-permissive niche. These findings have led to the development of a novel immune-based combinatorial approaches that decrease bone-metastatic outgrowth and enhance the effectiveness of agents solely aimed at systemic immune activation by increasing tumour cell immunogenicity. Stemming from this research, she is now working on the development of targetable immune signalling biomarkers of bone metastasis and is investigating how therapeutic induction of tumour-intrinsic immune pathways impacts prostate cancer diagnosis, risk stratification and patient outcome—a line of investigation that will be utilised in the PRECEPT program.</p>
