In 1992, Professor Hovens took up a post- doctoral position with Prof Walter Schaffner at the Institute for Molecular Biology in Zurich. In 1995, Prof Hovens moved to the Institute for Medical Virology in Zurich as an independent Group Leader, with an Honours student and two PhD students. Publications arising from the work here included papers in Journal of Cell Biology and Nature Biotechnology in 1999. In late 1998 Prof Hovens moved to the Dep. of Surgery Uni. of Melbourne as a Group Leader. He continued his collaboration with Dr Steve Stacker, Ludwig Institute, which resulted in a publication in Nature Genetics in 2000. In 2001 Professor Hovens was promoted to Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Surgery and then in 2005 as Director of the Prostate Cancer Research centre in the Departments of Urology and Surgery, University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2009 and to full Professor in 2016. His work has led to the co-discovery of a small, water soluble activator of the PP2A phosphates pathway and for which a number of international patent applications have been filed and a company founded, Velacor Therapeutics Pty Ltd, to commercialise this discovery. He has also developed a novel inhibitor of androgen signalling which has been commercialised through another start up, CCH Pharma Pty Ltd and which was the subject of multiple patent applications.</p>

Professor Papenfuss also led the establishment of the Australian Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Society Inc—our national peak body and professional society. He was founding President (2014-2018) and is the current Past President.</p><p> Professor Papenfuss’ research involves the development of novel computational methods to analyse and make sense of cancer '-omics' data, and he applies these methods to make new discoveries. A major focus of his work is cancer evolution, particularly in melanoma. He and his team are also interested in complex genomic rearrangements and the mechanisms underlying extreme amplification in genomes. His team has developed novel methods to identify these rearrangements that are amongst the current state-of-the-art. With this approach, his team recently discovered the dynamic mechanisms underlying the formation of giant cancer-associated neochromosomes, and have characterised how melanoma evolves.</p>

          <p>Margaret Centenera is a Research Fellow from the University of Adelaide, located at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI). Her research is focused on improving the clinical management of men with prostate cancer, through androgen receptor targeting, testing efficacy of novel therapeutics and discovery of innovative markers of response to current and emerging prostate cancer treatments. She obtained her Doctor of Philosophy in 2008 at the University of Adelaide. As part of her postdoctoral studies, Dr Centenera developed a patient-derived explant model of prostate cancer as a more clinically relevant and translational research approach. Dr Centenera spent 2012 as a visiting scholar in the USA, UK, Europe and Australia to train researchers on the explant technique. While at the University of Leuven in Belgium, she undertook a short-term Fellowship in the Laboratory of Lipid Metabolism and Cancer. On returning to Australia, Dr Centenera was appointed Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia Young Investigator from 2013 to 2015 at the University of Adelaide. In 2014, she was invited to join and help establish a new prostate cancer research group where she is now the Senior Research Fellow and leads a biomarker research program centred on the explant model.</p>

          <p>Ben Tran is a Medical Oncologist, MBBS, FRACP at the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and is a Clinician Scientist at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. His clinical focus is Genitourinary (GU) tumour stream, particular, testicular and urothelial cancers. Dr Tran’s research interests uniquely occupy the two ends of the spectrum in Early Drug Development, and Real World Data (RWD). He set up Australia’s first National Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Registry (ePAD), Australia’s first Testicular Cancer Registry (iTestis) and Australia’s first Bladder Cancer Registry (BLADDA). He believes that establishing robust platforms for RWD collection can facilitate research, not only data-related, but also translational by linking to tissue and blood specimens, and clinical through the conduct of registry-based trials. Grant funding has allowed him to conduct much of this research; since returning to Australia in early 2012, awarded several grants totalling almost $10M. Following completion of Medical Oncology training in Australia, Dr Tran completed an overseas Fellowship in Drug Development and Urological cancers at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada. There, he gained extensive experience in treating GU cancers, conducting Phase I clinical trials, implementing a large scale molecular profiling program and managing large multi-centre databases containing real world patient data. Dr Tran is currently leading the GU medical oncology program at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and the GU clinical trials program within the Parkville Cancer Clinical Trials Unit. Additionally, he holds several leadership positions within the National GU community, including Chair of the GU Tumour Group within Cancer Trials Australia, and Chair of the ANZUP Germ Cell Tumour Subcommittee. Regularly, Dr Tran is invited to speak at National scientific meetings and has been a member of the organising committee for several National conferences. He established Australia’s first Phase I clinic and is Principal Investigator on several Phase I studies including First Time in Human studies. Dr Tran’s research are internationally recognised with several International collaborations that have led to publications and presentations at International meetings, particularly in testicular cancer. He is on steering committees of two multinational research projects in testicular cancer, and have conducted research that has led to changes in clinical practice world-wide.</p>

          <h4 class="my-3">Career summary</h4>
          <p>Katie Owen is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Parker laboratory at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, headed by Associate Professor Belinda Parker. As an active member of both PRECEPT and the international prostate cancer research consortium, ProMis, Katie’s work focuses on understanding the immunoregulatory mechanisms that govern bone metastasis in castrate-resistant prostate cancer, including tumour cell dormancy and the eventual outgrowth of prostate cancer cells in the bone microenvironment. Her research has identified that suppression of a key innate immune signalling pathway in prostate cancer cells in bone impacts both bone homeostasis and immune surveillance mechanisms to engender a tumour-permissive niche. These findings have led to the development of a novel immune-based combinatorial approaches that decrease bone-metastatic outgrowth and enhance the effectiveness of agents solely aimed at systemic immune activation by increasing tumour cell immunogenicity. Stemming from this research, she is now working on the development of targetable immune signalling biomarkers of bone metastasis and is investigating how therapeutic induction of tumour-intrinsic immune pathways impacts prostate cancer diagnosis, risk stratification and patient outcome—a line of investigation that will be utilised in the PRECEPT program.</p>

          <h4 class="my-3">Career summary</h4>
          <p>After a varied career that included early work in machine learning with Artificial neural networks, teaching children with ASD, and volunteering to supervise learner drivers, in 2013 I started a change to bioinformatics with a graduate diploma at RMIT Melbourne. My next experience in this field was a VLSCI summer internship at La Trobe Institute of Molecular Science with Dr Brian Smith, editing a website application for predicting helices in proteins. Since 2014 I have been a research assistant in the Papenfuss Laboratory in the Bioinformatics Division at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Parkville, Melbourne. Most of my work has been on genome and DNA analysis, and data visualisation. In this role I have contributed to projects involving gene insertion in malaria parasites, describing the faecal microbiomes of healthy human volunteers and poisoned mice, and characterising variants in the genomes of prostate tumours and other cancers.</p>
