      <p>Objectives: To estimate the lifetime health and economic outcomes of selecting active surveillance (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP), or radiation therapy (RT) as initial management for low- or favorable-risk localized prostate cancer.</p><p>Methods: A discrete-event simulation model was developed using evidence from published randomized trials.

Although AS resulted in fewer treatment-related complications, it led to increased clinical progression (AS 40.7%, RP 17.6%, RT 19.9%) and metastatic disease (AS 13.4%, RP 6.1%, RT 7.0%). QALYs were 10.88 for AS, 11.10 for RP, and 11.13 for RT. Total costs were A$17 912 for AS, A$15 609 for RP, and A$15 118 for RT.

      <p>The accurate identification and effective removal of unwanted variation are essential to derive meaningful biological results from RNA-seq data, especially when the data come from large and complex studies. We have used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-seq data to show that library size, batch effects, and tumor purity are major sources of unwanted variation across all TCGA RNA-seq datasets and that existing gold standard approaches to normalizations fail to remove this unwanted variation. Additionally, we illustrate how different sources of unwanted variation can compromise downstream analyses, including gene co-expression, association between gene expression and survival outcomes, and cancer subtype identifications. Here, we propose the use of a novel strategy, pseudo-replicates of pseudo-samples (PRPS), to deploy the Removing Unwanted Variation III (RUV-III) method to remove different sources of unwanted variation from large and complex gene expression studies. Our approach requires at least one roughly known biologically homogenous subclass of samples shared across sources of unwanted variation. To create PRPS, we first need to identify the sources of unwanted variation, which we will call batches in the data. Then the gene expression measurements of biologically homogeneous sets of samples are averaged within batches, and the results called pseudo-samples. Pseudo-samples with the same biology and different batches are then defined to be pseudo-replicates and used in RUV-III as replicates. The variation between pseudo-samples of a set pseudo-replicates is mainly unwanted variation. We illustrate the value of our approach by comparing it to the TCGA normalizations on several TCGA RNA-seq datasets. RUV-III with PRPS can be used for any large genomics project involving multiple labs, technicians, or platforms.</p>

      <p>Context</p><p>Several liquid- and tissue-based biomarker tests (LTBTs) are available to inform the need for prostate biopsies and treatment of localised prostate cancer (PCa) through risk stratification, but translation into routine practice requires evidence of their clinical utility and economic impact.</p><p>Objective</p><p>To review and summarise the health economic evidence on the ability of LTBTs to inform decisions on prostate biopsies and treatment of localised PCa through risk stratification.</p><p>Evidence acquisition</p><p>A systematic search was performed in the EMBASE, MEDLINE, Health Technology Assessment, and National Health Service Health Economic Evaluation databases. Eligible publications were those presenting health economic evaluations of an LTBT to select individuals for biopsy or risk-stratify PCa patients for treatment. Data on the study objectives, context, methodology, clinical utility, and outcomes were extracted and summarised.</p><p>Evidence synthesis</p><p>Of the 22 studies included, 14 were focused on test-informed biopsies and eight on treatment selection. Most studies performed cost-effectiveness analyses (n = 7), followed by costing (n = 4) or budget impact analyses (n = 3). Most (18 of 22) studies concluded that biomarker tests could decrease health care costs or would be cost-effective. However, downstream consequences and long-term outcomes were typically not included in studies that evaluated LTBT to inform biopsies. Long-term effectiveness was modelled by linking evidence from different sources instead of using data from prospective studies.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Although studies concluded that LTBTs would probably be cost-saving or -effective, the strength of this evidence is disputable because of concerns around the validity and transparency of the assumptions made. This warrants prospective interventional trials to inform health economic analyses to ensure collection of direct evidence of clinical outcomes based on LTBT use.</p><p>Patient summary</p><p>We reviewed studies that evaluated whether blood, urine, and tissue tests can reduce the health and economic burden of prostate cancer. Results indicate that these tests could be cost-effective, but clinical studies of long-term outcomes are needed to confirm the findings.</p>

      <p>Background</p><p>Recent publications have shown patients with defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway driven by either MSH2 or MSH6 loss experience a significant increase in the incidence of prostate cancer. Moreover, this increased incidence of prostate cancer is accompanied by rapid disease progression and poor clinical outcomes.</p><p>Methods and results</p><p>We show that androgen-receptor activation, a key driver of prostate carcinogenesis, can disrupt the MSH2 gene in prostate cancer. We screened tumours from two cohorts (recurrent/non-recurrent) of prostate cancer patients to confirm the loss of MSH2 protein expression and identified decreased MSH2 expression in recurrent cases. Stratifying the independent TCGA prostate cancer cohort for MSH2/6 expression revealed that patients with lower levels of MSH2/6 had significant worse outcomes, in contrast, endometrial and colorectal cancer patients with lower MSH2/6 levels. MMRd endometrial and colorectal tumours showed the expected increase in mutational burden, microsatellite instability and enhanced immune cell mobilisation but this was not evident in prostate tumours.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>We have shown that loss or reduced levels of MSH2/MSH6 protein in prostate cancer is associated with poor outcome. However, our data indicate that this is not associated with a statistically significant increase in mutational burden, microsatellite instability or immune cell mobilisation in a cohort of primary prostate cancers.>/p>

      <p>Background</p><p>Ductal adenocarcinoma is an uncommon prostate cancer variant. Previous studies suggest that ductal variant histology may be associated with worse clinical outcomes, but these are difficult to interpret. To address this, we performed an international, multi-institutional study to describe the characteristics of ductal adenocarcinoma, particularly focussing on the effect of presence of ductal variant cancer on metastasis-free survival.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Patients with ductal variant histology from two institutional databases who underwent radical prostatectomies were identified and compared with an independent acinar adenocarcinoma cohort. After propensity score matching, the effect of the presence of ductal adenocarcinoma on time to biochemical recurrence, initiation of salvage therapy and the development of metastatic disease was determined. Deep whole-exome sequencing was performed for selected cases (n = 8).</p><p>Results</p><p>A total of 202 ductal adenocarcinoma and 2037 acinar adenocarcinoma cases were analysed. Survival analysis after matching demonstrated that patients with ductal variant histology had shorter salvage-free survival (8.1 versus 22.0 months, p = 0.03) and metastasis-free survival (6.7 versus 78.6 months, p < 0.0001). Ductal variant histology was consistently associated with RB1 loss, as well as copy number gains in TAP1, SLC4A2 and EHHADH.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>The presence of any ductal variant adenocarcinoma at the time of prostatectomy portends a worse clinical outcome than pure acinar cancers, with significantly shorter times to initiation of salvage therapies and the onset of metastatic disease. These features appear to be driven by uncoupling of chromosomal duplication from cell division, resulting in widespread copy number aberration with specific gain of genes implicated in treatment resistance.<p>

      <p>Background: Emerging data suggest that metastasis is a spectrum of disease burden rather than a binary state, and local therapies, such as radiation, might improve outcomes in oligometastasis. However, current definitions of oligometastasis are solely numerical.</p><p>Objective: To characterize the somatic mutational landscape across the disease spectrum of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) to elucidate a biological definition of oligometastatic CSPC.</p><p>Design, setting, and participants: This was a retrospective study of men with mCSPC who underwent clinical-grade sequencing of their tumors (269 primary tumor, 25 metastatic sites). Patients were classified as having biochemically recurrent (ie, micrometastatic), metachronous oligometastatic (≤5 lesions), metachronous polymetastatic (>5 lesions), or de novo metastatic (metastasis at diagnosis) disease.</p><p>Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We measured the frequency of driver mutations across metastatic classifications and the genomic associations with radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and time to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).</p><p>Results and limitations: The frequency of driver mutations in TP53 (p = 0.01), WNT (p = 0.08), and cell cycle (p = 0.04) genes increased across the mCSPC spectrum. TP53 mutation was associated with shorter rPFS (26.7 vs 48.6 mo; p = 0.002), and time to CRPC (95.6 vs 155.8 mo; p = 0.02) in men with oligometastasis, and identified men with polymetastasis with better rPFS (TP53 wild-type, 42.7 mo; TP53 mutated, 18.5 mo; p = 0.01). Mutations in TP53 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.45; p = 0.004) and DNA double-strand break repair (IRR 1.61; p < 0.001) were associated with a higher number of metastases. Mutations in TP53 were also independently associated with shorter rPFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; p = 0.03) and the development of CRPC (HR 1.71; p = 0.01) on multivariable analysis. This study was limited by its retrospective nature, sample size, and the use of commercially available sequencing platforms, resulting in a limited predefined set of genes examined.</p><p>Conclusions: Somatic mutational profiles reveal a spectrum of metastatic biology that helps in redefining oligometastasis beyond a simple binary state of lesion enumeration.</p><p> Patient summary: Oligometastatic prostate cancer is typically defined as less than three to five metastatic lesions and evidence suggests that using radiation or surgery to treat these sites improves clinical outcomes. As of now, treatment decisions for oligometastasis are solely defined according to the number of lesions. However, this study suggests that tumor mutational profiles can provide a biological definition of oligometastasis and complement currently used numerical definitions.</p>

      <p>Background: DNA originating from degenerate tumour cells can be detected in the circulation in many tumour types, where it can be used as a marker of disease burden as well as to monitor treatment response. Although circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) measurement has prognostic/predictive value in metastatic prostate cancer, its utility in localised disease is unknown.</p><p>Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing of tumour-normal pairs in eight patients with clinically localised disease undergoing prostatectomy, identifying high confidence genomic aberrations. A bespoke DNA capture and amplification panel against the highest prevalence, highest confidence aberrations for each individual was designed and used to interrogate ctDNA isolated from plasma prospectively obtained pre- and post- (24 h and 6 weeks) surgery. In a separate cohort (n = 189), we identified the presence of ctDNA TP53 mutations in preoperative plasma in a retrospective cohort and determined its association with biochemical- and metastasis-free survival.</p><p>Results: Tumour variants in ctDNA were positively identified pre-treatment in two of eight patients, which in both cases remained detectable postoperatively. Patients with tumour variants in ctDNA had extremely rapid disease recurrence and progression compared to those where variants could not be detected. In terms of aberrations targeted, single nucleotide and structural variants outperformed indels and copy number aberrations. Detection of ctDNA TP53 mutations was associated with a significantly shorter metastasis-free survival (6.2 vs. 9.5 years (HR 2.4; 95% CIs 1.2-4.8, p = 0.014).</p><p>Conclusions: CtDNA is uncommonly detected in localised prostate cancer, but its presence portends more rapidly progressive disease.</p>

      <p>The latency associated with bone metastasis emergence in castrate-resistant prostate cancer is attributed to dormancy, a state in which cancer cells persist prior to overt lesion formation. Using single-cell transcriptomics and ex vivo profiling, we have uncovered the critical role of tumor-intrinsic immune signaling in the retention of cancer cell dormancy. We demonstrate that loss of tumor-intrinsic type I IFN occurs in proliferating prostate cancer cells in bone. This loss suppresses tumor immunogenicity and therapeutic response and promotes bone cell activation to drive cancer progression. Restoration of tumor-intrinsic IFN signaling by HDAC inhibition increased tumor cell visibility, promoted long-term antitumor immunity, and blocked cancer growth in bone. Key findings were validated in patients, including loss of tumor-intrinsic IFN signaling and immunogenicity in bone metastases compared to primary tumors. Data herein provide a rationale as to why current immunotherapeutics fail in bone-metastatic prostate cancer, and provide a new therapeutic strategy to overcome the inefficacy of immune-based therapies in solid cancers.</p>
